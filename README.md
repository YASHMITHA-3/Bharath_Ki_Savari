###Intro: India, being the culturally rich and magnanimous country that it is, yet a lot of the great history and values of our incredible country are being lost. Bharath Ki Savari is our digital toy, which is our pursuit to revive the dimming knowledge of the rich cultural heritage of India in a fun and exciting manner, thus ensuring wholistic learning.

### ⚡ Problem Statement:Develop a Virtual Heritage Train using simulation that passes through Heritage Cities and helps to revive Indian Cultural Heritage.</i>

## PROJECT EXPLANATION
📌 Bharath ki Savari is our proposed toy, which is a digital application. It is based on the concept that our digital train will be travelling through different states in India, showing the cultural significance and heritage of each state as we pass by.

📌  As the techniques that are currently being used to teach the students are very monotonous, it does not kindle the students’ interest in learning.

📌 Bharath ki Savari on the other hand will be working on a whole new perspective, where experiencing a virtual tour across India will play the role of teaching and learning will be a spontaneous outcome of the entire experience of the journey.

📌 Our app, Bharath Ki Savari begins with the main page with the start button.

📌 On clicking the start button the Home Page will be opened, consisting of 2 buttons – one for the Savari and the other one for the Quiz.
