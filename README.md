## PROJECT EXPLANATION
📌 India, being the culturally rich and magnanimous country that it is, yet a lot of the great history and values of our incredible country are being lost. Bharath Ki Savari is our digital toy, which is our pursuit to revive the dimming knowledge of the rich cultural heritage of India in a fun and exciting manner, thus ensuring wholistic learning.Bharath ki Savari is our proposed toy, which is a digital application. It is based on the concept that our digital train will be travelling through different states in India, showing the cultural significance and heritage of each state as we pass by.As the techniques that are currently being used to teach the students are very monotonous, it does not kindle the students’ interest in learning.Bharath ki Savari on the other hand will be working on a whole new perspective, where experiencing a virtual tour across India will play the role of teaching and learning will be a spontaneous outcome of the entire experience of the journey. 
 
📌Our app, Bharath Ki Savari begins with the main page with the start button. 
 
📌On clicking the start button the Home Page will be opened, consisting of 2 buttons – one for the Savari and the other one for the Quiz. 
 
📌he Savari page consists of the list of all the states and union territories and upon selecting any one of them, the user will be directed to the home page of that state.

📌The home page of each state contains 3 options – Savari Video, Map and Gallery.

📌Savari video has an animated video of a tour of the state consisting of the famous monuments, culture, history and heritage of the state.

📌Map has the real-time map where that particular state will be pinned.
 
📌Gallery page further has 3 options – VR Guide, Image Gallery and Upload to the Gallery

📌VR Guide contains a VR 360 video of some of the famous monuments or tourist spots of that state.

📌Image Gallery has images of some of the famous monuments or tourist spots of that state.

📌Upload to the Gallery has an option where the users can upload real images related to the cultural heritage of that state directly from the user’s phone gallery. The uploaded images will be sent to the server side for verification and authentication after which the image update will be reflected on the app.

📌The Quiz section consists of options which enables the users to choose the state based on which they want to take the quiz, the level of difficulty and start the quiz.

📌After starting the quiz the users have to complete a each question in given time limit. After answering each question the score is updated and the right option is highlighted with green and wrong answer is highlighted with red.
